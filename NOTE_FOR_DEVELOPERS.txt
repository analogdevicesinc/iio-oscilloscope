1. Please use Glade for GTK2 (v3.8) when adding new glade files or when editing files that were created with Glade for GTK2.
2. When a glade file has already been created/edited with Glade for GTK3 (versions 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, etc.) and you need to edit it, use the fixup scripts from dev-tools on the modified glade file. If Glade 3.8 is used the fixup scripts are no longer required.
